LIB /DEF:sqlite3.def
* creates .lib and .ext files (x86)

cl /I libraries /Fe"chaos" /EHsc main.cpp dbmanager.cpp libraries\sqlite3.lib
* includes libraries folder for dependencies
* name output file as 'chaos.exe' (main automatically opens. mouse options.)

* this method of doing things might not fully work (it compiles fine but using SQLite functions make it angry and produce no output)
